```bash
docker-compose -f compose.yaml up -d
```

This will set up and start the necessary services for the application.

### Step 3: Build and Run FreelanceApplication

Navigate to the FreelancePlatform directory, build the project using Maven, and start the application:

```bash
cd FreelancePlatform
mvn clean install -DskipTests
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 4: Build and Run NotificationService

Open another terminal and navigate to the NotificationService directory, build the project using Maven, and start the application:

```bash
cd freelance_platform/NotificationService
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 5: Build and Run Front-end
1. [Download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/)Â the latest LTS version of Node.js.
2. Run `node -v` in the console and make sure that the installed Node.js version is not lower than v8.11.3.;
3. Run `npm -v` in the console and make sure that the installed npm version is not lower than 5.6.0.
4. Navigate to the project directory after cloning by running the command: `cd freelance_platform\nssfrontend`.;
5. To install the project dependencies, run the command `npm install`.
6. To start the project in development mode, run the command `npm run start`.
7. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. Once the page loads, you will see a page."
8. Open Chrome Dev Tools and navigate to the Console tab; there should be no errors.

## Deploy on production server

Here you can explore our web service:

backend: https://freelance-platform-3-0-2.onrender.com

frontend: https://shestser.github.io/nssSp/

Note: at the moment, not all the functionality of the application works on the product server

- DTO
- MVC
- Dependency injection
- Strategy - path: notificationService/notificationStrategies
- Builder - Mapper.userDTOToUser() method
- Modular approach - frontend with React
